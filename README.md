Developed a Python-based QR Code Generator and Scanner application to create and read QR codes for various types of data such as URLs, text, contact details, and payment information. The application allows users to generate customized QR codes and decode existing QR codes efficiently.

Used Python libraries such as qrcode, OpenCV, and Pillow for QR code generation, image processing, and scanning. Implemented features like error correction, size customization, and image export, along with real-time QR code detection using a webcam. The system ensures fast and accurate decoding and supports multiple QR formats.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of Python programming, image processing, and automation, and can be applied in areas like digital payments, ticketing systems, and inventory management.
